  Dividend Finance offers residential solar loans, home improvement, and PACE financing products. That includes web-portals for installers and home-owners, together with comprehensive API for partners: financial institutions and solar energy installation companies.

  APIs used as a backend for Dividend's portals and as a public set of endpoints for partners. They are built on Clojure stack (loosely based on Luminus) with Salesforce and PostgreSQL as the system of record.

  Fronted apps are built with Clojurescript (Re-frame), and Material UI React components, meant to be utilized from mobile and desktop devices.
