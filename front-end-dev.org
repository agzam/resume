## Current status:
* Working at [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com) and not available for hire

## About me:

* I love creating modern web/hybrid apps backed by Clojurescript/Clojure and Node.js
* I have done and participated in various projects - in building interactive, responsive and adaptive web apps, complex enterprise-level solutions, mobile apps, cloud services and APIs
* Relentlessly trying to improve my own productivity and sharing my knowledge with my colleagues. As my best lifetime investment, I consider time spent on learning [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) and plethora of other tools
* During my career I have attained proficiency and explored languages like: JavaScript, Lua, Coffeescript, Typescript, Livescript, C#, Python and Clojure
* I am familiar with Ruby, Java ans SQL
* Outside of work I am looking forward to learn Haskell, Purescript, Elm and Racket, planning to dig into [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io), venture into category theory and machine learning algorithms
