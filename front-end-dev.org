## Current status:

## About me:

* I have done and participated in various projects - in building interactive, responsive and adaptive web apps, complex enterprise-level solutions, mobile apps, cloud services and APIs
* Enthusiast of test automation, I like [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [generative testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) and anything related to testing
* I understand [OOP principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) but prefer functional programming constructs, [immutable data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) and [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) 
* Relentlessly try to improve my productivity. I consider time spent on learning [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) and plethora of other tools as my best lifetime investment
* During my career I have attained proficiency and explored languages like: JavaScript, Coffeescript, Typescript, Livescript, C#, Python and Clojure
