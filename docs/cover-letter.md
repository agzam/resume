Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Ag, and I am an accomplished software engineer with over 15 years of diverse experience spanning multiple programming languages, industries, and system types. My strengths include problem-solving and the swift acquisition of language and domain knowledge. These skills have made me highly effective in adapting to and overcoming new technological challenges.

In recent years, I have focused on using Clojure, a language in which I have substantial expertise. However, my broad programming background includes successful projects using Javascript, Typescript, Python, C#, F#, Emacs Lisp, Lua, and Fennel. Regardless of the language or environment, I have consistently been able to master and apply any stack, framework or industry standard to provide measurable value.

A notable aspect of my career has been my contribution to various industries, creating systems for sectors such as video processing — where I constructed a video encoding engine that was ten times more efficient than its predecessor; retail sales — where I dealt with continuously changing requirements; finance — where money necessitated reliability and defect-free software; cybersecurity — where I developed a keen comprehension of advanced cybersecurity strategies. In each of these positions, I've tried to develop a deep understanding of the respective field. This multi-sector experience has honed my skills in developing mobile and web applications, as well as backend systems. I am also proficient with various front-end and backend frameworks.

In addition to my professional experience, I am an active participant in the open-source community. I have authored several unique Emacs packages, created video tutorials for educational purposes, and made significant contributions to various projects. I highly value the automation of processes to increase efficiency and precision. Currently, I am progressing through the SANS Institute certification course “SEC 504: Hacker Tools, Techniques, and Incident Handling” and learning Spanish in my free time.

In summary, I am excited about the prospect of bringing my technological expertise, adaptability, and passion to your dynamic team. I am confident that my wide-ranging industry experience and keen interest in learning new technologies can significantly enhance your team and improve its cybersecurity posture.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to potentially discussing how my experience and skills align with your team's needs.

Best Regards,
Ag.
