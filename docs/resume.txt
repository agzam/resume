 Portal was built in Clojurescript, initially using Om.next, and later we switched to Re-frame. A set of APIs, made with Clojure, were created for the backend. Materialized views in PostgreSQL were used, where data gets aggregated from Kafka clusters ingested via Kafka Connect.
 We introduced unique concepts on the front end, such as using Integrant to compartmentalize UI elements into individual components - specs, styles, and render functions, essentially transforming them into highly versatile Lego pieces.
